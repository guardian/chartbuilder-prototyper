This makes responsive charts based on a Google sheet synced to S3 (manually via [visuals/docs](https://visuals.gutools.co.uk/docs/)), or a JSON object written directly to S3 (if you want to automate your chart making).

It allows for responsive annotations, updating charts in place without changing embeds, trendlines, and a bunch of other formats and features not available in the basic chart tool. Is also allows charts to be created either via the google docs -> s3 system, or programatically for charts you'd like to keep constantly updated. It is however more complicated to use, and requires some technical knowledge.

To use:

1. Put your data and chart furniture into a google spreadsheet (or JSON object with the same structure), see examples below
2. Publish your spreadsheet to S3 using the [docs tool](https://visuals.gutools.co.uk/docs/) or the backup docs tool
3. Append the spreadsheet key to the following URL like so:
